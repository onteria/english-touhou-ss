Touhou SS
=========

This is a place for me to keep my English Touhou short stories. It's somewhat of a plan to see how git works with short story development. The idea is having branches for hashing out different parts of the story. Gives me a chance to experiment around and revert back to different versions of files if I don't like where something is going.
